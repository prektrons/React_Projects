"# React_Projects" 

I have used VSCode as editor. In VSCode I have installed Simple React Snippets-(Burke Holland)for React and Prettier for formatting as Extensions.Also added to chrome broswer is the React Developer Tools extension.

Commands: 
npm install -g create-react-app
npm i create-react-app
npm i nx
npm init react-app my-app

OR 

npx create-react-app demo

cd app-name
npm start

The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.
