"# React_Projects" 

I have used VSCode as editor. In VSCode I have installed Simple React Snippets-(Burke Holland)for React and Prettier for formatting as Extensions.Also added to chrome broswer is the React Developer Tools extension.

Commands: 
npm install -g create-react-app
npm i create-react-app
npm i nx
npm init react-app my-app

OR 

npx create-react-app demo

cd app-name
npm start

React follows the principle of component-based architecture. A component in React is an isolated and reusable piece of code. The components can be of two types – class components and functional components.

The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

Props are used to pass data, whereas state is for managing data.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

super() is used to call the parent constructor.

super(props) would pass props to the parent constructor.

From your example, super(props) would call the React.Component constructor passing in props as the argument.


React Hooks are functions that add state variables to functional components and instrument the lifecycle methods of classes.

With React Hooks, we can use state, and other React features, in a functional component. It empowers devs to do functional programming in React.

React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects.
