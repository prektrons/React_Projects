"# React_Projects" 

I have used VSCode as editor. In VSCode I have installed Simple React Snippets-(Burke Holland)for React and Prettier for formatting as Extensions.Also added to chrome broswer is the React Developer Tools extension.

Commands: 
npm install -g create-react-app
npm i create-react-app
npm i nx
npm init react-app my-app

OR
